This is the documentation for pyflct.

pyflct is Python wrapper that allows a user to perform Fourier Local Correlation Tracking (FLCT).
The C-based implementation of the FLCT algorithm is developed by George H. Fisher and Brian T. Welsch
and `the source code can be found here <http://cgem.ssl.berkeley.edu/cgi-bin/cgem/FLCT/home>`__.

The following papers are references for the FLCT algorithm:

* `Welsch et al., ApJ 610, 1148, (2004) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/421767>`__
* `Fisher & Welsch, PASP 383, 373, (2008) <https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.4289>`__
* `Fisher et al., ApJS 248, 1, (2020) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4365/ab8303>`__

Our Example Gallery provides examples on how to use the Python wrapper.
